## Contract overview

| Contract Name              | Lines of Code |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `Swap.sol`                 | 263           |
| `Math.sol`                 | 20            |
| `EmergencyGovernable.sol`  | 64            |
| `EmergencyPausable.sol`    | 26            |
| `MockZrxExchangeProxy.sol` | 73            |
| `MockToken.sol`            | 9             |
| **Total**                  | **455**       |

### Dependencies

The main contract is `Swap.sol`, which executes quotes provided off-chain by the
[0x API](https://0x.org/docs/api) in the Tally wallet, taking swap fees for the
DAO. It relies on `SafeMath.sol`, `SafeERC20.sol`, and `ReentrancyGuard.sol`
from the OpenZeppelin contracts library.

## System overview

The Tally wallet is an EOA wallet that runs as a browser extension. Though Tally
isn't a "smart contract wallet", preferring to custody user funds outside smart
contracts to save on gas, a number of features in the wallet require paired
smart contracts. Tally Swap is one of those features.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [X] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [X] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [X] Designate someone (or a team of people) to monitor DMs & questions in the C4 Discord (**#questions** channel) daily (Note: please *don't* discuss issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.)
